Impact of Chronic Stress on Diabetes Progression

Current research emphasizes the significant role of chronic stress in exacerbating Type 2 diabetes, particularly among adolescents, who lately present severe insulin resistance
(Huybrechts et al., 2014). Adolescence marks a period of increased insulin resistance due to hormonal shifts associated with puberty, compounded in teens with Type 2 diabetes by obesity, poor diet, and sedentary behavior (De Vasconcelos et al., 2010). Chronic stress further
aggravates this insulin resistance, impairing glycemic control and increasing the risk of

early-onset complications such as cardiovascular disease and fatty liver disease (Mosienko et al., 2024). Although numerous studies examine the impact of diet and exercise on Type 2 diabetes in adolescents, research focusing on chronic psychological stress and its direct physiological effects on insulin resistance and diabetes progression remains limited.
This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by investigating how sustained stress might accelerate diabetes progression in teenagers. Through HumMod simulations, which allow detailed physiological modeling, we simulate the effects of chronic stress on blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and metabolic health in white male teenagers with Type 2 diabetes. The choice of adolescent males as the study population is intentional, as they are statistically less
susceptible to the early development of Type 2 diabetes and its minor progression when compared to other demographics (Pinhas-Hamiel & Zeitler, 2023). Using white, male
adolescents ensures a controlled and focused analysis of physiological responses, reducing confounding variables associated with ethnicity and gender differences in diabetes management.
 
The primary objective of this experiment is to determine how sustained cortisol elevation

impacts insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and overall diabetes progression in adolescents with Type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that prolonged high cortisol levels will result in increased insulin resistance, higher fasting and postprandial blood glucose, and elevated HbA1c over time. We further hypothesize that the chronic stress will lead to adverse metabolic changes, such as increased inflammatory markers and altered lipid profiles, exacerbating the progression of diabetes.
To test these hypotheses, the HumMod simulation is designed to expose teenage subjects to controlled chronic stress conditions, represented by sustained elevations in cortisol levels. This study will follow a 12-month simulated timeline, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of long-term impacts on diabetes-related health markers. The simulation will analyze changes in insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and inflammatory markers, and it will compare these outcomes with those in non-stressed control subjects.
If chronic stress leads to a significant increase in insulin resistance and impaired glycemic control, then these findings would support the hypothesis that stress management is critical for mitigating diabetes progression in adolescents (Perfect et al., 2010). Additionally, if inflammatory markers rise alongside worsening glycemic control, then it would indicate a link between stress-induced inflammation and diabetes complications. These outcomes would
underscore the importance of early intervention for stress management in teenage patients with Type 2 diabetes, supporting a more holistic approach to adolescent diabetes care (Eva et al., 2018).

Overall, this is an excellent submission. The role of chronic stress in terms of the progression of Type 2 diabetes is a worthwhile area for investigation, and the discussion at the end of the submission about how the study may shed light on the need for early stress intervention provides clear relevance for the study. The choice of using white male participants is well justified.

Major concerns:
1.	You seem to be suggesting that ‚Äúinsulin resistance‚Äù and ‚ÄúType 2 diabetes‚Äù are different. For example, you say ‚Äúinsulin resistance‚Ä¶is compounded in teens with Type 2 diabetes‚Äù. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, so you should revise your submission to ensure that Type 2 diabetes is defined properly.
2.	It is unclear whether your study will address how Type 2 diabetes progresses in patients who already have the disorder and now are exposed to chronic stress, or whether you will be assessing whether chronic stress can bring about insulin resistance (and, thus, Type 2 diabetes). Please clarify.
3.	The term ‚Äúmetabolic health‚Äù is not defined here, so it is unclear what parameters will actually be measured to assess it. Is ‚Äúmetabolic health‚Äù even necessary here? Could the study not simply examine how resting blood glucose and insulin levels change, or perhaps conduct oral glucose tolerance tests to assess the progression of Type 2 diabetes?
4.	Inflammatory markers cannot be assessed in HumMod, so this part of the submission should be omitted.
5.	Will the study involve administering cortisol to participants, or will the ‚Äústress‚Äù levels be increased? The latter is probably more relevant for your study.
6.	There is considerable redundancy in your submission. Three separate times you indicate the parameters you will be assessing. Revise your submission so it‚Äôs more concise. 

Minor concerns:
1.	‚Äúwho lately present severe insulin resistance‚Äù ‚Äì This sentence is awkward and should be revised for improved clarity.
2.	Although you will be simulating your experiment using HumMod, it is preferable that the your submission is written as if the research will be conducted using real participants.
3.	Gender is a social construct. In biological studies, the term ‚Äúsex‚Äù is preferable.
