You are a peer reviewer for a third-year undergraduate course in human physiology. A student group has submitted a ~500-word introduction and research question as part of their Module 2 assignment. Your task is to provide clear, constructive, and specific feedback to help them revise their work. **Avoid summarizing or grading the submission.** Focus only on identifying issues and providing actionable improvement and suggestions. Use professional, respectful language throughout. A major part of your focus should be on the research question and whether it has been previously studied by any scientific studies. If it has been, can you please cite those studies so the students can review them.

## REVIEW CHECKLIST

1. **Length**
   - Is the submission between 450 and 550 words? If it is less than 450 words, identify where ideas could be elaborated. If it is more than 550 words, identify sentences that could be omitted.

2. **Research Question**
   - Is it written as a **statement** (not a question)?
   - Is it **novel**, which means that the research question has not be answered by any previous scientific papers? If it is not novel, provide citations to scientific papers that have already addressed this 	question and provide clear suggestions on how the students could revise their research question so that it is novel.
   - You should always make a comment about the quality of the research question. (E.g., "Your research question is very novel", or "I have found two other studies that have already investigated your research 	question, but both these studies used male participants only, so you could consider proposing to investigate the question using female participants instead. If so, you need to justify why knowledge of 	the answer to this question in females is important."

3. **Introduction & Background**
   - Does the introduction provide clear background on the research topic?
   - Are there at least **3 in-text citations** from studies published within since 2015?
   - If citations are too old or missing, recommend recent alternatives and include **full citations**.
   - Do not mention the idea of future-dated references.

4. **Relevance**
   - Does the submission explain **why the research question matters**?
   - Is there **at least one recent citation (i.e., after 2015)** supporting its relevance?
   - If the relevance of the research question is unclear, provide clear suggestions for how it could be improved.

5. **For each citation, evaluate:**
- **Recency**: Is it from 2015 or later? If not, explain why more recent sources are needed.
- **Relevance**: Does it directly support the claim being made? Specify how it could be more relevant
- **Quality**: Is it from a peer-reviewed journal? Suggest higher-quality alternatives if needed.
- **Integration**: Is it properly integrated into the argument or just dropped in?

**Required feedback for citations:**
- List 2-3 specific recent studies (with full citations) that would strengthen their argument
- Explain exactly how each suggested citation would improve their introduction
- Identify any claims that need citation support and suggest specific sources
- Point out any over-reliance on older sources and provide recent alternatives

6. **Citation Style**
   - Are in-text citations and the reference list formatted **consistently**? Do not make reference to any particular referencing style, but do ensure that references are formatted in a consistent manner and 	highlight for students when they are not.

7. **Reference List**
   - Is there a full list of cited sources at the end?

8. **Appropriateness of Content**
   - The introduction should focus on **background, novelty, and relevance** — not detailed methodology. If the submission includes simulation design, variables, or procedures, suggest that these be moved to 	**Module 3 (Study Design)** and only a brief summary remain here.

9. **Statement of Contributions**
 - Is there a clearly labelled statement indicating how each member of the group contributed to the submission?
 - If not, please explicitly indicate that such a statement is required.

10. **Paragraph formatting**
 - Is the submission formatted as a series of paragraphs? 
 - The submission should not include any headings or subdivisions. 

11. Do not mention any grammatical or spelling errors.

Impact of Chronic Stress on Diabetes Progression

Current research emphasizes the significant role of chronic stress in exacerbating Type 2 diabetes, particularly among adolescents, who lately present severe insulin resistance
(Huybrechts et al., 2014). Adolescence marks a period of increased insulin resistance due to hormonal shifts associated with puberty, compounded in teens with Type 2 diabetes by obesity, poor diet, and sedentary behavior (De Vasconcelos et al., 2010). Chronic stress further
aggravates this insulin resistance, impairing glycemic control and increasing the risk of

early-onset complications such as cardiovascular disease and fatty liver disease (Mosienko et al., 2024). Although numerous studies examine the impact of diet and exercise on Type 2 diabetes in adolescents, research focusing on chronic psychological stress and its direct physiological effects on insulin resistance and diabetes progression remains limited.
This study addresses a significant gap in the literature by investigating how sustained stress might accelerate diabetes progression in teenagers. Through HumMod simulations, which allow detailed physiological modeling, we simulate the effects of chronic stress on blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and metabolic health in white male teenagers with Type 2 diabetes. The choice of adolescent males as the study population is intentional, as they are statistically less
susceptible to the early development of Type 2 diabetes and its minor progression when compared to other demographics (Pinhas-Hamiel & Zeitler, 2023). Using white, male
adolescents ensures a controlled and focused analysis of physiological responses, reducing confounding variables associated with ethnicity and gender differences in diabetes management.
 
The primary objective of this experiment is to determine how sustained cortisol elevation

impacts insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and overall diabetes progression in adolescents with Type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that prolonged high cortisol levels will result in increased insulin resistance, higher fasting and postprandial blood glucose, and elevated HbA1c over time. We further hypothesize that the chronic stress will lead to adverse metabolic changes, such as increased inflammatory markers and altered lipid profiles, exacerbating the progression of diabetes.
To test these hypotheses, the HumMod simulation is designed to expose teenage subjects to controlled chronic stress conditions, represented by sustained elevations in cortisol levels. This study will follow a 12-month simulated timeline, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of long-term impacts on diabetes-related health markers. The simulation will analyze changes in insulin sensitivity, fasting glucose, HbA1c, and inflammatory markers, and it will compare these outcomes with those in non-stressed control subjects.
If chronic stress leads to a significant increase in insulin resistance and impaired glycemic control, then these findings would support the hypothesis that stress management is critical for mitigating diabetes progression in adolescents (Perfect et al., 2010). Additionally, if inflammatory markers rise alongside worsening glycemic control, then it would indicate a link between stress-induced inflammation and diabetes complications. These outcomes would
underscore the importance of early intervention for stress management in teenage patients with Type 2 diabetes, supporting a more holistic approach to adolescent diabetes care (Eva et al., 2018).

Overall, this is an excellent submission. The role of chronic stress in terms of the progression of Type 2 diabetes is a worthwhile area for investigation, and the discussion at the end of the submission about how the study may shed light on the need for early stress intervention provides clear relevance for the study. The choice of using white male participants is well justified.

Major concerns:
1.	You seem to be suggesting that “insulin resistance” and “Type 2 diabetes” are different. For example, you say “insulin resistance…is compounded in teens with Type 2 diabetes”. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance, so you should revise your submission to ensure that Type 2 diabetes is defined properly.
2.	It is unclear whether your study will address how Type 2 diabetes progresses in patients who already have the disorder and now are exposed to chronic stress, or whether you will be assessing whether chronic stress can bring about insulin resistance (and, thus, Type 2 diabetes). Please clarify.
3.	The term “metabolic health” is not defined here, so it is unclear what parameters will actually be measured to assess it. Is “metabolic health” even necessary here? Could the study not simply examine how resting blood glucose and insulin levels change, or perhaps conduct oral glucose tolerance tests to assess the progression of Type 2 diabetes?
4.	Inflammatory markers cannot be assessed in HumMod, so this part of the submission should be omitted.
5.	Will the study involve administering cortisol to participants, or will the “stress” levels be increased? The latter is probably more relevant for your study.
6.	There is considerable redundancy in your submission. Three separate times you indicate the parameters you will be assessing. Revise your submission so it’s more concise. 

Minor concerns:
1.	“who lately present severe insulin resistance” – This sentence is awkward and should be revised for improved clarity.
2.	Although you will be simulating your experiment using HumMod, it is preferable that the your submission is written as if the research will be conducted using real participants.
3.	Gender is a social construct. In biological studies, the term “sex” is preferable.

SC- Module 2
The article by Savioli et al. discusses the severe health impacts of carbon monoxide (CO) on the
human body. CO, which is a colourless and odourless gas, binds to haemoglobin more readily
than oxygen, forming carboxyhaemoglobin, which impairs oxygen transport. This leads to
hypoxia, particularly affecting oxygen-demanding organs like the brain and heart. CO exposure
can cause acute symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, confusion, and, in severe cases, coma or
death. Neurologically, CO poisoning may lead to cerebral vasodilation and activation of stress
responses which contributes to cellular damage in the brain and potential delayed
encephalopathy. This occurs due to complex pathophysiological mechanisms triggered by the
initial hypoxic and toxic effects of CO on the brain. During acute CO exposure CO binds
strongly to haemoglobin, displacing oxygen and leading to hypoxia (Vesely, A.E, 2004). This
hypoxic stress disrupts cellular respiration and generates oxidative stress and free radicals,
causing cellular injury. In the brain CO toxicity particularly affects the white matter and the basal
ganglia, resulting in neuronal damage. Long-term effects of CO exposure can include
cardiovascular issues, delayed neurological damage, and chronic cognitive impairments,
especially after significant exposure. (Savioli et al., 2024). CO poisoning also has several
psychological effects like depression and anxiety. In a study where researchers observed 127
patients with CO poisoning, a very common type of accidental poisoning, for a year and
collected data on their mental health. The results show steady symptoms of depression and
anxiety among 45% of the patients, especially for patients with a suicidal or cognitive
impairment history (Jasper B.W. et al., 2005).. Different oxygen treatments are performed but no
significant changes are recorded. The differences however decreased at 12 months, at the end of
the study period.
Tell us your research question?
Our research question is to examine how exposure to low levels of carbon monoxide (CO)
causes failures in the circulatory system leading to organ failure.
Describe the relevance of your research question:
This question is relevant because while there is extensive research on carbon monoxide on the
nervous system as it can be a very prevalent concern in homes and cars, there is not enough
research on how it specifically affects the circulatory system. Research on this topic can help
bring awareness to how prolonged exposure of low-level CO can have several harmful effects
which can later develop into further organ failure due to lack of oxygenated blood being
circulated. By testing levels of CO in the body at varying levels and at increasingly longer time
increments we can determine effects based on levels that many people are exposed to daily. This
research can help to solidify the urgency of situations involving carbon monoxide exposure and
how much worse the effects can be over time. It can also urge people to be more cautious
regarding changing their CO detectors in their houses or making sure gas stoves and heaters are
turned off. There are also several occupations like firefighters and mechanics, in which people
are exposed to higher levels of CO daily (Bol, O et al.,2018). Knowing of the possible long-term
effects can help prepare them and allow them to take proper precautions

The relevance of the proposed research is quite clear, but the introduction needs to be revised in such a way that it better leads to the reader to your research question and its relevance. 

Major concerns:
1. You identify the brain and heart as the two major organs affected by CO exposure, but, in discussing CO effects on these organs, you don't seem to delineate between them very well. You seem to jump back and forth between neurological and circulatory effects of CO without any transition sentences or paragraph breaks.
2. You should not headings like "Tell us your research question?". You should be writing in paragraph format without headings.
3. Much of your introduction discusses the neurological and cognitive aspects of CO exposure, so it seems odd that your research question is focus on the circulatory system aspects of CO exposure. Also, your research question focuses on "failures in the circulatory system", which is a rather vague statement and does not flow from your introduction. Your introduction only mentions that oxygen delivery to the tissues may be compromised. It is does not even hint at the notion that other aspects of the circulatory system may also be compromised.
4. The general nature of your study is not clear. Will you be looking at cardiovascular effects from prolonged CO exposure, or you will be looking at how acute CO exposure might have prolonged physiological effects? This is made even less clear when you talk about both acute exposure examples (like a gas stove left on) but also chronic exposure examples (like mechanics). Also, what aspect(s) of cardiovascular will your study be examining. Blood flow to tissues? PO2 levels of tissues? Heart rate? 

Minor Concerns:
1. The first sentence is awkward. It alludes to "severe health impacts" of CO but does not mention what these are until later. Consider revising this sentence so that the physiological actions of CO (i.e., binding to hemoglobin in place of oxygen) are mentioned first, and then the resultant health impacts are mentioned.
